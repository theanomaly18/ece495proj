# Project Handrail
## Introduction
Project Handrail is a site that allows users to mark spots on a map of
cool skateboarding/snowboarding spots to let others know about them! In a 
new city? Or just want to know about more spots in your current town? Then
this site is perfect for you!!

## How to Use
### Finding a Spot
To find a spot, you can use the map to search around any area of your choosing
to see what spots have been marked. Clicking on the displayed markers allows
you to see more information about the spot, including an address and a 
description from the person who marked it! Viewing more information about 
the spot will also allow you to see user comments about the spot!

### Marking a Spot
Marking a spot is very easy! Locating the "New Spot" link on our page and fill 
out the simple form! With all the information provided from you, our site will 
display your spot on the map!

## Future Development
* A fully functional store
* User system to regulate and moderate posts
